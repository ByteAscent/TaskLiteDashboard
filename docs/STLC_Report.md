# STLC Report for Task Management Dashboard

## 1. Introduction
### Project Overview
The **Task Management Dashboard** is a lightweight web application that allows users to manage tasks with functionalities like creation, updating, deletion, and organization through tags and filters. The QA process ensures that the application maintains high standards of quality through automated testing and comprehensive validation.

### QA Objectives
- Validate that all task management features function correctly.
- Ensure a consistent and responsive user experience.
- Implement end-to-end and regression testing to maintain stability.
- Identify and document defects effectively for continuous improvement.

## 2. Test Planning
### QA Strategy
- **Testing Approach**: Utilize automated end-to-end testing, unit tests for core functions, and performance checks.
- **Tools Used**: Playwright for automated tests, GitHub Issues for bug tracking.
- **Environment Setup**:
  - **Browsers**: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit.
  - **Devices**: Desktop and mobile simulations.
  - **Operating System**: Windows/Linux/Mac for cross-platform compatibility.

### Test Environment Configuration
- **Test Server**: Local Node.js server running the back end with JSON data storage.
- **Front-End Interface**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS.
- **Test Framework**: Playwright for automated end-to-end tests.

## 3. Test Design
### Test Cases and Scenarios
- **User Interface Tests**:
  - Verify that the UI elements (buttons, forms, task lists) render correctly on different screen sizes.
  - Check for visual consistency across various browsers.
- **Functional Tests**:
  - **Task Creation**: Test adding a task with valid and invalid inputs.
  - **Task Editing**: Ensure editing a task updates the data and UI appropriately.
  - **Task Deletion**: Validate that deleting a task removes it from the UI and database.
  - **Filtering and Searching**: Test that task filters and search functions work as intended.
- **Validation Tests**:
  - Check form validation for empty fields, invalid inputs, and edge cases.
- **Regression Tests**:
  - Verify that new changes do not break existing features.
- **Performance Tests**:
  - Measure page load times and API response times to ensure optimal performance.

### Test Data Preparation
- **Sample Data**: Create sample task data for testing CRUD operations.
- **Edge Cases**: Prepare data for special cases such as tasks with special characters and long descriptions.

## 4. Test Execution
### Test Execution Summary
- **Process**: Run automated Playwright scripts for end-to-end and functional testing.
- **Results**:
  - Record pass/fail status for each test case.
  - Document screenshots for any failed tests or visual discrepancies.

### Key Results
- **Overall Pass Rate**: *Placeholder for pass rate statistics*.
- **Execution Time**: *Placeholder for average test execution time*.
- **Screenshots and Logs**: Attach logs or screenshots generated during the tests.

## 5. Defect Tracking and Reporting
### Bug Reporting
- **Tool Used**: GitHub Issues for logging and tracking defects.
- **Defect Life Cycle**:
  1. **Identification**: Log the defect with steps to reproduce, severity, and screenshots.
  2. **Assignment**: Assign the defect to the relevant developer for fixing.
  3. **Verification**: Retest the issue after a fix has been applied.
  4. **Closure**: Close the issue after successful verification.

### Common Issues
*Placeholder: List any recurring issues or notable bugs encountered during testing.*

## 6. Regression Testing
### Automation Strategy
- Integrate regression testing scripts into the Playwright suite.
- Schedule regular test runs to ensure continuous integration and stability.
- **Coverage Metrics**: Track test coverage to identify untested areas.

### Visual Regression
- Use Playwrightâ€™s screenshot feature to compare UI changes and detect visual regressions.
- **Comparison Reports**: Generate reports indicating differences between versions.

## 7. Performance and Load Testing
### Performance Test Details
- **Tool Used**: Playwright for measuring page load and API response times.
- **Key Metrics**:
  - **Page Load Time**: Ensure it meets the performance benchmark.
  - **API Response Time**: Validate the time taken for CRUD operations.

### Load Testing
- Implement scripts to simulate multiple users interacting with the app simultaneously.
- **Results**: Document findings on how the app performs under load.

## 8. Test Reports and Documentation
### Test Reports
- **Generated Reports**: Include Playwright test result reports and visual regression logs.
- **Test Summary Document**: A document summarizing all testing activities and outcomes.

### Documentation Links
- *Placeholder: Link to test reports or evidence stored in your project repository.*

## 9. Maintenance and Future Improvements
### Continuous Testing Plan
- Schedule automated test runs after every major code update.
- Regularly update test cases and scenarios to reflect new features.

### Potential Enhancements
- Expand the test suite to include additional edge cases.
- Integrate additional performance monitoring tools if necessary.
