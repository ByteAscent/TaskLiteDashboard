# Test Plan for Task Management Dashboard

## 1. Introduction
### Project Overview
The **TaskLite Dashboard** is a web application that allows users to create, update, delete, and organize tasks with customizable tags and filters. This test plan outlines the testing approach to ensure the quality and reliability of the application.

### Objectives
- Validate that all task management functionalities work as expected.
- Ensure the application meets functional, non-functional, and performance requirements.
- Identify and document defects to be resolved before deployment.

## 2. Scope of Testing
### In-Scope
- **Functional Testing**: Task creation, updating, deletion, and filtering.
- **User Interface Testing**: Verifying UI components for responsiveness and consistency.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Testing**: Complete user journey from adding a task to updating and deleting it.
- **Regression Testing**: Ensuring new changes do not break existing functionalities.
- **Performance Testing**: Measuring page load time and API response times.
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Testing on Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.

### Out-of-Scope
- **Backend Security Testing**: This will not be covered in the initial test plan.
- **Advanced Load Testing**: Stress testing for a large number of users is deferred for future phases.

## 3. Test Strategy
### Testing Approach
- **Manual Testing** for initial verification of UI elements and form validations.
- **Automated Testing** using Playwright for E2E, regression, and cross-browser testing.

### Test Levels
- **Unit Testing**: Basic tests on individual functions using manual testing or simple scripts.
- **Integration Testing**: Verifying the interaction between the front end and API endpoints.
- **System Testing**: Full testing of the integrated system.

### Test Types
- **Functional Testing**: Ensure each function performs as expected.
- **UI Testing**: Check for consistency and proper rendering on various devices and browsers.
- **Regression Testing**: Run automated tests after updates to verify no unintended issues.
- **Performance Testing**: Assess page load times and response times.

## 4. Test Environment
### Hardware and Software Requirements
- **Hardware**: Laptop/desktop with modern specifications.
- **Software**:
  - **Browsers**: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit.
  - **Node.js**: For running the back end and tests.
  - **Playwright**: For automated testing.
- **Test Server**: Local server running Node.js with JSON data storage.
- **Test Data**: Predefined sample tasks for testing various cases.

## 5. Test Tools
### Primary Tools
- **Playwright**: For E2E, UI, regression, and performance testing.
- **GitHub Issues**: For defect logging and tracking.

## 6. Test Cases and Scenarios
### High-Level Test Scenarios
- **Task Creation**:
  - Verify task creation with valid inputs.
  - Verify form validation for missing or invalid inputs.
- **Task Editing**:
  - Confirm the task can be edited and updates are reflected in the UI.
- **Task Deletion**:
  - Ensure a task can be deleted and no longer appears in the list.
- **Filtering and Searching**:
  - Validate that tasks can be filtered by tags and status.
  - Test the search functionality for different keywords.
- **UI Checks**:
  - Confirm all UI components render correctly on desktop and mobile.
- **Performance**:
  - Measure and verify page load time is under defined thresholds.

## 7. Defect Management
### Bug Reporting
- **Tool**: GitHub Issues.
- **Process**:
  1. **Log the defect** with a detailed description, steps to reproduce, severity, and screenshots.
  2. **Assign the defect** to a developer.
  3. **Verify** the fix after the issue is resolved.
  4. **Close** the defect upon successful verification.

## 8. Test Schedule
### Milestones
- **Initial Manual Testing**: Start date and duration.
- **Automated Test Development**: Start date and duration.
- **Full Test Execution**: Planned start date and estimated time frame.
- **Regression Test Runs**: Schedule after each significant update.

## 9. Entry and Exit Criteria
### Entry Criteria
- Development of core features is completed.
- Test environment is set up and operational.

### Exit Criteria
- All planned test cases have been executed.
- No critical defects remain unresolved.
- Test summary report completed and reviewed.

## 10. Risks and Mitigations
### Potential Risks
- **Limited Testing Time**: Risk of not completing all test cases within the scheduled time.
- **Tool Limitations**: Potential limitations in Playwright for specific testing needs.

### Mitigation Strategies
- Prioritize critical test cases.
- Plan test automation to cover essential functions early.
